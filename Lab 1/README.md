# The Report

## Part 0. Know Your Master

Before the 90s, there was no simple way to read a watch in the dark. People had to either move to a brighter room or hold a light against their watch to read the time. That's where the American watchmaking company, Timex, came in to save the day. Timex released its Indiglo watch in 1992, setting the standard of backlit watch faces as a key feature of all watches to come.

**The core interaction:** To read the time in the dark, users can simply press the crown button on the side of the watch, triggering the watch face light to turn on. After a few seconds, the light turns off automatically.

**Strengths:** The indiglo technology was a lot safer than early attempts at producing watch face luminescence. Watchmakers had initially used a mix of radium and zinc sulfide to create the backlit glow, but this came with radioactive dangers. While safer iterations were released afterwards, they often didn't have a long-lasting glow. Timex solved these issues by building electroluminescent panels into the watch.

**Weaknesses:** The indiglo light is designed to only stay on for short periods of time, and relies on the user interaction of pressing the crown. If the crown-pressing feature stops working, the user will not be able to turn on the light.

## Part A. Plan

- **Setting:** In a dark room or the pitch-black night.
- **Players:** Ben 10 (the hero); someone screaming for help outside while a villain threatens them; a hidden wizard operating the light
- **Activity:** Ben 10 is awoken by his watch flashing an alert that a villain is nearby. He hears screams from the street below through his bedroom window, and decides 'it's hero time.' He twists the crown of his watch to select the best alien hero form he can transform into to defeat the villain. Once he makes a decision, he slams his watch and turns into the alien hero.
- **Goals:** The people in danger want to survive, while the villain outside wants to cause them harm. Ben 10 wants to save the innocent people by transforming into the alien form he selected on his watch and defeating the villain. The hidden wizard wants the light to feel alive and in sync with Ben 10's actions.

### Storyboards
**Iteration 1:** A very simple visual of the indiglo interaction. A user in a dark room wants to check the time, so they press the crown of the watch, which then illuminates the watch face and reveals the time.<br><br>

**Iteration 2**: Marisol and I recalled our childhood obsession with Ben 10, and decided to spruce up the interaction using Ben 10 as the main user.<br><br>

**Iteration 3:** After acting out the scene (see Part B below) and playing around with the Tinkerbelle tool, we had to redesign the interaction to work around limitations of the tool and satisfy more use cases (ex: alert of danger nearby, choosing an alien form, turning into the alien form).<br><br>

**TODO: Summarize the feedback you got here.**

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

When we acted out the sequence, we discovered the following:
- We noticed that we needed to add a reason/intent for the user to check their watch
- We decided that we would need to use 2 colors, red and green, to differentiate between the feedback states of the indiglo (red for alerts, green for alien selection)
- We realized that to visualize the interaction of Ben 10 switching between aliens by turning the crown on his watch, we needed to add more light interaction: light goes from black to green when an alien is selected
- For recording the interaction, we realized that we need to adjust some of the angles of the scene to ensure the watch face was visible

We used these findings to iterate on our storyboard, resulting in the final storyboard above (Iteration 3).

## Part C. Prototype the Light (light first!)

**We only focused on light this week; no other modalities.**

We used the Tinkerbelle tool, where the phone screen acted as the indiglo light and the laptop controlled its brightness and color. In order to simulate a blinking/flashing effect for the villain alert and alien selection interactions, we used the slider feature to rapidly switch between a black and red/green glow on the phone. We also made sure to time the 'flashing' with the turn of the crown when Ben 10 is looking for an alien on his watch.

**Feedback on Tinkerbelle:** While the slider feature was fast enough for us to simulate a flashing effect, we wished there could've been a built-in blink/flash setting in the tool, where we could also adjust the latency of the blinking (in seconds).

## Part D. Wizard the Device

One of us hid off-camera as the wizard, watching Ben 10's actions and using the Tinkerbelle controls on the laptop to time the light interactions. We recorded using Zoom.

See our first wizarded attempt here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42269kgHxoI

## Part E. Costume the Device

We wanted to costume the phone to look more like a watch for a more realistic experience. We used paper and drew a watch, with a cutout for the watch face so that the phone light (our indiglo) can shine through:<br>

**Concerns/opportunities in shaping the look:** The material has to be transparent enough to let light through the watch face cutout, but opaque enough that the watch band/design is visible. We also tried to use a color scheme of green, gray, and black to fit the Ben 10 universe.

## Part F. Record

**Video Sketch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fDFrM_SdIQ 

**Our aim:** Viewers who know Ben 10 will recognize the importance of his watch and its light interactions, but viewers who may not be familiar can still indentify the role that the indiglo light plays in helping the hero save the day.

**Collaborators and influences:**
- Marisol Park (Ben 10)
- Neeha Ravula (Wizard and Person In Danger)
- Ben 10, the cartoon hero of our childhood

# Part 2 — ReMastering the light

*This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.*

## Prep (before the next lab)

Find three other groups. (How? Maybe Slack?) Visit their Lab Hub pages, watch their
videos, and give them reactions and feedback: tell them what you saw happening,
guess the masterwork and the goals of the characters, and ask about anything that
wasn't clear.

**Group 1: [Pepper's Ghost](https://github.com/mc3223/Peppers-Ghost/blob/Fall2026/Lab%201/light-and-interaction.MOV)**
What I liked:
- It was cool that they got it to work, and the ghost image was super clear!
- They put in a lot of effort with the setup to create the ghost
What I wished for:
- It would've been cooler if we could'nt see the end of the acryllic "glass" in the video; it would make the ghost effect look more realistic
- It would've been cool if it the room was completely dark to better see the effect

**Group 2: [Project Blinkenlights](https://github.com/Elliot-verified/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2026/Lab%201/README.md)**
What we liked:
- it was a very cool, engaging interaction
- latency was really good, the visuals updated super fast
- also liked how easy it is to use; you can interact from any phone
What could have been better:
- would be cool if you could make ascii art
- would be fun if you can change colors / customize

**Group 3: [Laser Tag](https://github.com/mado0512/Interactive-Lab-Hub/tree/Fall2026/Lab%201)**
what we liked:
- very clear what was happening, we were able to identify the masterwork before even looking at the repo readme
- the glow of the light was super luminous lol
improvements:
- some sound/shooting noise to indicate that the person has been tagged
- when the person is tagged, the light goes green -- instead we recommend you choose red or some other color, cause green usually indicates something positive

## Remix, Update, or Critique the Master

Now that you understand your masterwork from the inside, respond to it. Do the
recreation again, but this time make it your own — pick one of these moves (or
combine them):

1. **Remix the modality.** Your recreation no longer has to (just) use light. Use
   vibration, sound, motion, heat — whatever best carries the interaction. Feel
   free to fork and modify the Tinkerbelle code. (Add your updates to this lab's folder!)
2. **Update it.** Redesign the piece for today's context, or for a setting its
   creators never imagined (the piece with roommates in the room, with children
   present, on a phone, in a car).
3. **Fix its weaknesses.** You identified this master's strengths and weaknesses
   in Part 0 — now address a weakness, or push a strength further.

We will grade this second pass with an emphasis on **creativity** and on how well
your response engages with what your master was really doing.

**Document everything here — especially the storyboard and video. Photos of the
prototype are great too.**
